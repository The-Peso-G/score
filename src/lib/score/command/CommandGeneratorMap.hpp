/**
 * \file CommandGeneratorMap.hpp
 *
 * This file contains utility classes to instantiate commands
 * when they are received from the network, or reloaded after a crash.
 *
 * For each command, a factory will be generated and stored in a map with
 * the command name, to allow fast instantiation upon command reception.
 *
 * Each command has two identifiers :
 * * One is the \ref CommandGroupKey used to differentiate groups of commands
 * * One is the \ref CommandKey used to differentiate commands in a same group
 *
 * They are stored in a \ref CommandData upon serialization, along with
 * the command-specific data.
 *
 * Reinstatiation is donne through \ref
 * score::ApplicationContext::instantiateUndoCommand.
 *
 * OPTIMIZEME: right now the names are used, it should be nice to migrate
 * towards uids.
 * OPTIMIZEME : maybe we could just concatenate both keys and have a single
 * hash_map...
